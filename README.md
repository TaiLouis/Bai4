equests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to urllib3.

User Testimonials
Nike, Twitter, Spotify, Microsoft, Amazon, Lyft, BuzzFeed, Reddit, The NSA, Her Majesty’s Government, Google, Twilio, Runscope, Mozilla, Heroku, PayPal, NPR, Obama for America, Transifex, Native Instruments, The Washington Post, SoundCloud, Kippt, Sony, and Federal U.S. Institutions that prefer to be unnamed claim to use Requests internally.

Armin Ronacher, creator of Flask—
Requests is the perfect example how beautiful an API can be with the right level of abstraction.
Matt DeBoard—
I’m going to get Kenneth Reitz’s Python requests module tattooed on my body, somehow. The whole thing.
Daniel Greenfeld—
Nuked a 1200 LOC spaghetti code library with 10 lines of code thanks to Kenneth Reitz’s Requests library. Today has been AWESOME.
Kenny Meyers—
Python HTTP: When in doubt, or when not in doubt, use Requests. Beautiful, simple, Pythonic.
Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 400,000 downloads each day. Join the party!

If your organization uses Requests internally, consider supporting the development of 3.0. Your generosity will be greatly appreciated, and help drive the project forward into the future.
